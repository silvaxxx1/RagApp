# 🧠 RagApp – End-to-End Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System

**RagApp** is a minimal yet extensible project to build a complete **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system from scratch — covering every major component from data ingestion to LLM-based generation and full-stack deployment.

This project aims to provide a clear, modular, and hands-on framework for learning, experimentation, and real-world application of RAG-based architectures.

> 🔧 We will incrementally evolve this into a production-ready, full-stack RAG system.

## ✅ What to Expect

- Clean architecture with modular components
- Local and cloud-ready (Docker + API-first design)
- Focus on **fast prototyping**, **inference efficiency**, and **open-source extensibility**

---

## 🛠️ Work in Progress

This repo is currently in active development — we’ll be iterating quickly to add:

- 📄 Chunking + embedding logic
- 🔍 Vector search & retrievers
- 🧠 Prompt templates and LLM generation
- ⚙️ FastAPI backend
- 🖥️ Frontend interface (optional)
- 🚀 Deployment-ready setup

Stay tuned and feel free to fork, clone, and follow along as we build the system step by step!
